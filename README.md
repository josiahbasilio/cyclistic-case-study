# cyclistic-case-study

The Google Data Analystics Capstone Project using Divvy bike data.

This case study was completed as part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. 

The Mission Statement: The bike-sharing company (Cyclistic) wants to analyze their user's data to find the differences in behaviour between their two types of users, the "casual" riders who pay for each ride and the "annual" rider who pays a yearly subcription to the service. 

## PHASE 1: ASK 
### Key objectives:
1. Identify the business task: the company wants to increase their earnings by reaching out to "casual" riders, for that they would have to analyze in what aspects the "casual" and the "annual" customers differ, and to be able to create a successful marketing message to the "casual" customer that makes them convert to the "annual" subcription. 

2. Consider key stakeholders: the main stakeholders is Lily Moreno the director of marketing and my manager, the marketing analytics team, and the Cyclistic executive team. 

## PHASE 2: PREPARE
### Key objectives: 
1. The credibility of the data: The data was downloaded directly from Divvy Bikes website: https://ride.divvybikes.com/system-data 

The data was organized by months, and assumed to be credible since it was published and compiled by the organization. Within the data, there were some anomalies (these were highlighted in the presentation file).

2. Sort and filter the data: For the analysis I'm going to be focused on the 2020-2021 period as it's more relevant period to the business task, and it was a more complete data with types of bikes used and geo-location coordinates. 

3. We are using the dataset from Septmember 2020 to August 2021.

4. Organize the data in folders and subfolders, using proper naming conventions and saved the data as csv files.

5. Sort and Filter the Data: Data is too large for spreadsheets 

Imported the data to Postgresql and sorted it by writing SQL querry for removing nulls from all columns.
